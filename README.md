This analysis is upto date until September 2023.  

### Data Exploration with SQL
The project begins with an EDA done in SQL.  
The overall dataset is broken into two different datasets, CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations.  
Through the different columns such as total cases, total deaths, and total vaccinations are measured across countries, continents, and dates that these datapoints were taken in.
